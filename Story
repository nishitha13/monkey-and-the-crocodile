The kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits.
The crocodile came back the next day for more fruits because he loved them.
As the days passed by, the crocodile and the monkey became friends.
Once day, the monkey sent some fruits for the crocodile's wife.
She ate the fruits and liked them, but was jealous as she didn't like her husband spending time with the monkey.
She told her husband,"If the fruits so juicy, I wonder how sweet the monkey's heart would be. Get me his heart."
The crocodile was willing to kill his friend but had no other choice.
